          Ironman Triathlon</a
        >
        is one of a series of long-distance triathlon races organized by the
        World Triathlon Corporati (WTC), consisting of a 2.4-mile (3.86 km)
        swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride and a marathon 26.22-mile
        (42.20 km) run, raced in that order. It is widely considered one of the
        most difficult one-day sporting events in the world. Most Ironman events
        have a limited time of16 or 17 hours to complete the race, course
        dependent. The race typically starts at 7:00am; the mandatory swim cut
        off for the 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim is 9:20am (2 hours 20 minutes), the
        mandatory bike cut off time is 5:30pm (8 hours 10 minutes), and the
        mandatory marathon cut off is midnight (6 hours 30 minutes). Any
        participant who manages to complete the triathlon within these time
        constraints is designated an Ironman. The name "Ironman Triathlon" is
        also associated with the original Ironman triathlon which is now the
        Ironman World Championship. Held in Kailua-Kona, the world championship
        has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978 (with an additional race in
        1982). Originally taking place in Oahu, the race moved to Kailua-Kona in
        1981, where it continues today. The Ironman World Championship has
        become known for its grueling length, harsh race conditions, and
        television coverage. Other races exist that are of the same distance as
        an Ironman triathlon but are not produced, owned, or licensed by the
        World Triathlon Corporation. Such races include The Challenge Family
        series' Challenge Roth and the Norseman Triathlon.

      <h2 style="padding: 5px 25px">Some History</h2>
      <p class="pIndex">
        The idea for the original Ironman Triathlon arose during the awards
        ceremony for the 1977 OÊ»ahu Perimeter Relay. Among the participants were
        representatives of both the Mid-Pacific Road Runners and the Waikiki
        Swim Club, whose members had long been debating which athletes were more
        fit, runners or swimmers. On this occasion, U.S. Navy Commander John
        Collins pointed out that a recent article in Sports Illustrated magazine
        had declared that Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx had the highest recorded
        "oxygen uptake" of any athlete ever measured, so perhaps cyclists were
        more fit than anyone. Collins and his wife Judy Collins had taken part
        in the triathlons staged in 1974 and 1975 by the San Diego Track Club in
        and around Mission Bay, California, as well as the 1975 Optimist Sports
        Fiesta Triathlon in Coronado, California. A number of the other military
        athletes in attendance were also familiar with the San Diego races, so
        they understood the concept when Collins suggested that the debate
        should be settled through a race combining the three existing
        long-distance competitions already on the island: the Waikiki Roughwater
        Swim (2.4 mi or 3.9 km), the Around-Oahu Bike Race (115 mi or 185 km;
        originally a two-day event) and the Honolulu Marathon (26.219 mi or
        42.195 km). Until that point, no one present had ever done the bike
        race. Collins calculated that by shaving 3 miles (4.8 km) off the course
        and riding counter-clockwise around the island, the bike leg could start
        at the finish of the Waikiki Rough Water and end at the Aloha Tower, the
        traditional start of the Honolulu Marathon. Prior to racing, each
        athlete received three sheets of paper listing a few rules and a course
        description. Handwritten on the last page was this exhortation: "Swim
        2.4 miles! Bike 112 miles! Run 26.2 miles! Brag for the rest of your
        life", now a registered trademark. With a nod to a local runner who was
        notorious for his demanding workouts, Collins said, "Whoever finishes
        first, we'll call him the Iron Man." Each of the racers had their own
        support crew to supply water, food and encouragement during the event.
        Of the fifteen men to start off in the early morning on February 18,
        1978, twelve completed the race. Gordon Haller, a US Navy Communications
        Specialist, was the first to earn the title Ironman by completing the
        course with a time of 11 hours, 46 minutes, 58 seconds. The runner-up
        John Dunbar, a US Navy SEAL, led after the second transition and had a
        chance to win but ran out of water on the marathon course; his support
        crew resorted to giving him beer instead. With no further marketing
        efforts, the race gathered as many as 50 athletes in 1979. The race,
        however, was postponed a day because of bad weather conditions. Only
        fifteen competitors started off the race Sunday morning. San Diego's Tom
        Warren won in 11 hours, 15 minutes, 56 seconds. Lyn Lemaire, a
        championship cyclist from Boston, placed sixth overall and became the
        first "Ironwoman". Collins planned on changing the race into a relay
        event to draw more participants, but Sports Illustrated's journalist
        Barry McDermott, in the area to cover a golf tournament, discovered the
        race and wrote a ten-page account of it. During the following year,
        hundreds of curious participants contacted Collins.

      <h2 style="padding: 5px 25px">And IRONMAN Today</h2>
      <p class="pIndex">
        The Ironman format remains unchanged, and the Hawaiian Ironman is still
        regarded as an honored and prestigious triathlon event to win worldwide.
        People completing such an event within the strict event time cutoffs are
        agreed to be recognized as "Ironmen"; the plural "Ironmans" refers to
        multiples of "Ironman" as a short form of "Ironman Triathlon." In the
        triathlon community an Ironman is someone who has completed a race of
        the appropriate distance, whether or not it falls under the aegis of
        WTC.
