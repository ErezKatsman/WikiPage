            is an athletic shoe company originating in France that designs and
            markets running shoes. The brand first gained attention in the
            running industry by producing shoes with oversized outsoles, dubbed
            "maximalist" shoes due to extra cushion; this was in contrast to the
            minimalist shoes trend that was gaining popularity at the time of
            the company's founding in 2009.
